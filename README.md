ABOUT THE CODE
Import the Scanner class: This allows us to take input from the user.
Create a Scanner object: This object will be used to read user input.
Prompt for two numbers: We ask the user to input two numbers, which we store as num1 and num2.
Prompt for an operation: We display a menu of operations and read the user's choice.
Perform the chosen operation: Based on the user's choice, we perform the selected arithmetic operation using a switch statement.
Handle division by zero: We include a check to prevent division by zero.
Close the Scanner object: Itâ€™s good practice to close the Scanner when it's no longer needed to free up resources.
